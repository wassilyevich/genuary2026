# Genuary 2026 — Day 1  
**Prompt:** _<One color, one shape.>_

## Concept

An algorithm that allows the creation of a pseudo-freeform Hitomezashi pattern - that is penplottable.
Because of the solid-void pattern, a monochrome drawing can be made. The entire pattern is driven by randomness + a single freeform line shape.


## Output

Generated output (images, video, renders) is **not tracked in this repository** but available on my Instagram.

## Reproducibility

This sketch is made using canvas-sketch by Matt DesLauriers - so reproducing it should be straight forward using this code and his API.
