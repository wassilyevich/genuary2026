# Genuary 2026 — Day 2  
**Prompt:** _<Twelve principles of animation.>_

---

## Concept

The stretch and squatch principle is explored by actually drawing a ball bouncing left to right frame by frame on a single piece of paper. Each frame is then sliced to make an animation (like in the old days). Some small tweaks are made in Photoshop for upscaling the video.


## Output

Generated output (images, video, renders) is **not tracked in this repository** but available on my Instagram.

## Reproducibility

This sketch is made using canvas-sketch by Matt DesLauriers - so reproducing it should be straight forward using this code and his API.
